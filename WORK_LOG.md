| 12/2  |   2:45-3pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       We spent the last bit of class after the quiz to think about possible solutions and our first thought was hashing because Mr. Blick said Lucas' hashing solution sounded neat. However, we did not know where to go from there so we thought of over possible solutions. It was pretty hard to think about it but we got to some possible solutions like changing out roots of words or even just common words. I think I will try to implement a solution that replaces common words. |
| 12/2  |  8:30-9:30pm  |                                                                                                                              I decided that my first attempt would be replacing the most common words I could find with numbers. I did not really know where to start or have a dictionary of common letters, so I started by searching up the most common words and hard coded them into a String array. From there, my compression algorithm was easy to make because I would just compare all of my dict words to the words in the text (will take a while I know). Then I would read the number into the compressed file where the original common word is. I am bit confused on how I would expand the compressed file efficiently, but I will save that for next time. |
| 12/3  |   3:15-4pm    | I decided the start on my expansion algorithm. I did not have any idea on how I would expand my compressed file efficiently, so I decided to do it very heavy handed. I just set up an if condition for every common world and would read the word to the out.text. I know realize that I am not sure if I am allowed to mix and match 4 bit data with 8 bit String data. I am not sure if every single string has to be compressed. I spent some more time thinking and realized this solution would not be possible because then the bits would be mixed up between 4 & 8 bits, which would be very hard to expand. After a little bit more thinking, an easier way that I thought of was to use 7 or 6 bits to represent each word because text does not use all of Ascii |
| 12/8  |  8:45-9:15am  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I did the reading for the problem set and started on my code. Everything made sense in the reading, except the base case is still a bit confusing to me. However, I decided to start with the coding. I got the pseudo code written down, but I am a bit confused on where to go, especially with relating the index to the prefix. |
| 12/8  | 10:10-10:40am |                                                                                                                                                                                           I went to CS tutorial to ask Mr. Blick a few questions about the problem set. I first asked about what to start prefix as. He simply told me it should be the first char that I check. Then, I asked him about the edge case and he told me a short solution, but I was still confused so I decided to wait for the next class where he would explain it to us. Then I asked him about the pseudo code line "Prefix = longest coded word that matches text @ index" which I was a bit confused how to do until he explained that he already made a method and told me what it did. |
| 12/8  | 11:40-11:55am |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         For the last bit of class, I worked on the compress function a little more. I took what Mr. Blick told me in tutorial and started to implement each part. I found it a bit confusing what to put in the parameters for each function, so hopefully I did it right. I am still a bit confused on the edge case so I will leave that until I read the expand function. |
| 12/8  |  7:20-7:50pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I started to work on my final expansion algorithm. There is not pseudo code for this function so it was harder for me to start. I am not completely finished but I traced the slides and the table to write what I have now. I think for the most part my code is correct, but I am still confused where to implement my base case. I will ask classmates and Mr. Blick next class on how to solve these issues. |
| 12/10 | 9:20-10:35am  |                                               I finished compress and expand. After asking some classmates, the base case was really easy to implement. However, I had some errors before my code starting working. First, my codes were incorrect in the compressed file, but it was an easy fix. All I had to do was just read in 8 bits instead of an entire int. Next, nothing was being written into my expanded file, this was simply fixed by adding a close to the BinaryStd to allow the buffer to read in the rest of the data. Last, my code was getting an index out of bounds for the larger text files. This was because I did not set a cap on the amount of codes that could be added or expanded from. I just added an conditional statement to solve this. |
