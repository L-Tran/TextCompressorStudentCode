However, we did not know where to go from there so we thought of over possible solutions. It was pretty hard to think about it but we got to some possible solutions like changing out roots of words or even just common words. I think I will try to implement a solution that replaces common words. |
| 12/2 | 8:30-9:30pm | I decided that my first attempt would be replacing the most common words I could find with numbers. I did not really know where to start or have a dictionary of common letters, so I started by searching up the most common words and hard coded them into a String array. From there, my compression algorithm was easy to make because I would just compare all of my dict words to the words in the text (will take a while I know). Then I would read the number into the compressed file where the original common word is. I am bit confused on how I would expand the compressed file efficiently, but I will save that for next time. |
