However, we did not know where to go from there so we thought of over possible solutions. It was pretty hard to think about it but we got to some possible solutions like changing out roots of words or even just common words. I think I will try to implement a solution that replaces common words. |
| 12/2 | 8:30-9:30pm |                                                                                                                              I decided that my first attempt would be replacing the most common words I could find with numbers. I did not really know where to start or have a dictionary of common letters, so I started by searching up the most common words and hard coded them into a String array. From there, my compression algorithm was easy to make because I would just compare all of my dict words to the words in the text (will take a while I know). Then I would read the number into the compressed file where the original common word is. I am bit confused on how I would expand the compressed file efficiently, but I will save that for next time. |
| 12/3 |  3:15-4pm   | I decided the start on my expansion algorithm. I did not have any idea on how I would expand my compressed file efficiently, so I decided to do it very heavy handed. I just set up an if condition for every common world and would read the word to the out.text. I know realize that I am not sure if I am allowed to mix and match 4 bit data with 8 bit String data. I am not sure if every single string has to be compressed. I spent some more time thinking and realized this solution would not be possible because then the bits would be mixed up between 4 & 8 bits, which would be very hard to expand. After a little bit more thinking, an easier way that I thought of was to use 7 or 6 bits to represent each word because text does not use all of Ascii |
